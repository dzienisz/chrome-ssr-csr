# CSR vs SSR Detector

[![Chrome Web Store](https://img.shields.io/chrome-web-store/v/fhiopdjeekafnhmfbcfoolhejdgjpkgg)](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/csr-vs-ssr-detector/fhiopdjeekafnhmfbcfoolhejdgjpkgg)

The **CSR vs SSR Detector** is a Chrome extension that allows users to identify whether a webpage is rendered using Client-Side Rendering (CSR) or Server-Side Rendering (SSR). Understanding this distinction is essential for making informed decisions about SEO, page performance, and overall application architecture.

## Features

- **SEO Insights**: Helps developers and SEO specialists determine the rendering method to ensure pages are optimized for search engine crawlers.
- **Performance Analysis**: Quickly determine rendering strategies to optimize load times and user experience.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Offers immediate results without the need to dig through the code.

## How It Works

The extension analyzes the content of the page to detect if it was rendered on the server or by the client. It then provides this information in a clear, easily accessible format within your Chrome browser.
