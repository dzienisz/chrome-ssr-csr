## Detailed Description

**CSR vs SSR Detector** - Identify rendering strategies instantly with detailed analysis and framework detection.

üéØ **What It Does**
Instantly analyze any webpage to determine its rendering method with 95% accuracy. Perfect for developers, SEO specialists, and web architects making critical performance decisions.

‚ú® **Key Features**

‚Ä¢ **Accurate Detection** - Advanced algorithm analyzes 15+ indicators including DOM structure, framework markers, performance metrics, and meta tags

‚Ä¢ **Framework Recognition** - Automatically detects:
  - SSR Frameworks: Next.js, Nuxt, Gatsby, Remix, SvelteKit, Astro, Qwik, SolidJS
  - Static Generators: Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy, Hexo
  - SPA Frameworks: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte

‚Ä¢ **Detailed Analysis** - View confidence scores, performance metrics (DOM ready time, First Contentful Paint), and key detection indicators

‚Ä¢ **History Tracking** - Keep track of your last 10 analyses for easy comparison

‚Ä¢ **Privacy-First** - All analysis happens locally on your device. No data sent to external servers.

‚Ä¢ **Instant Results** - One-click analysis with clear visual feedback

üìä **Why It Matters**

**For SEO Optimization**
Server-side rendered pages are typically better indexed by search engines. Know exactly how search bots see your content.

**For Performance Analysis**
Understand rendering strategies to optimize load times and user experience. SSR provides faster initial loads, while CSR enables rich interactions.

**For Development & Debugging**
Quickly identify rendering methods without digging through code. Essential for auditing competitor sites or debugging your own applications.

**For Architectural Decisions**
Make informed choices between SSR, CSR, or hybrid approaches based on actual implementation examples.
